/**
 * How many review rounds a change has had, and how many of the latest round's findings are about what the previous round
 * changed — the two numbers that say whether a change is converging.
 *
 * `repair-by-another-author` AC-3, and it is the criterion that cannot be argued with: it counts rather than judges. The five
 * rounds of `closure-gate` were reconstructed by hand from a directory listing to reach the conclusion that the change could not
 * be finished by its author; this makes that reconstruction a command.
 *
 * **A round is a record, not an attempt.** A round that produced nothing leaves no trace here — which is honest (there is
 * nothing to report) and is also the reason the count can be lower than the number of rounds actually run. `closure-gate` had
 * five attempts and four records, and `unrecorded` is reported for exactly that reason rather than being papered over.
